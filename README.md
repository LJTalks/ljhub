# LJ Hub – Project Overview

## Purpose:

**LJHub** is a centralized platform where users can explore services, book appointments, and engage with blog content.

The platform aims to provide a seamless experience for users seeking professional services such as mentoring or video editing while offering access to digital products like PDFs, online courses, and webinars. The site also maintains a personal blog where the admin can share updates, business insights, and resources.

**Digital Nomads**: People who are looking for the freedom to work from anywhere and live a flexible lifestyle.

**Aspiring developers and learners** looking for insights through blog posts and mentoring.

**Individuals Who Want to be Heard**: People looking to get their voice out there, build their personal brand, and share their story or expertise online.

**Potential clients exploring professional services** like website building or management, software solutions, video editing, social media management, and more.

Users can purchase and access digital products like PDFs, online courses, and webinars.

Once a service is booked or a product is purchased, users can view their upcoming bookings and access purchased digital content.

Users can view available time slots for services that require a booking (e.g., mentoring, discovery calls).

Bookings are confirmed automatically once the user completes required steps (e.g., payment, questionnaire submission).

Users cannot cancel or edit bookings themselves; any changes must be requested by contacting the service provider directly.

The system prevents double-booking of the same time slot.

Logged-in users can leave comments on blog posts, and comments can be moderated.

Admins can track user activity, handle cancellations, and ensure the system runs smoothly.

Automated notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, reminders, and product access.

Email and/or SMS reminders can be sent to users before upcoming bookings, if they opt in.

**Tracking Purchases and Bookings**:

Users can view both their upcoming bookings and their history of purchased digital products.

The system differentiates between services (mentoring, editing) and digital products (PDFs, online courses, etc.).
